# CleanYouTubeExtension4Staff
This extension puts a “toggle button” on the browser that defaults to filtering everything from YouTube, except for the video you are
watching. Users can “untangle” the extension and grant themselves full access to youtube. Written for classroom teachers who are sensitive on what is shown on their classroom projectors.
